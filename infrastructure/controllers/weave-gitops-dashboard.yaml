spec:
  # Install remediation retries and we set it to negative one.
  # So what are we doing here?
  # The dashboard and the ingress controller are installed together at the same time.
  # The ingress controller takes about a minute to be fully functional within that minute.
  # The dashboard helm release fails several times and would not retry the installation.
  # What we are doing here is instructing the helm controller to keep on retrying the installation.
  # The retrial is part of the remediation mechanism of the helm controller.
  # We can set the maximum number of retries.
  # The controller will attempt to install the chart.
  # Setting it to a negative number means the controller should try indefinitely.
  # This ensures that the we've GitOps chart keeps retrying until the ingress controller is ready.
